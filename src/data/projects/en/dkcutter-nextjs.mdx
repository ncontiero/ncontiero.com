Powered by [DKCutter](https://dkcutter.ncontiero.com/), DKCutter Next.js is a framework for quickly starting Next.Js projects.

- If you have problems with DKCutter Next.js, please open [issues](https://github.com/ncontiero/dkcutter-nextjs/issues/new).

## Usage

To scaffold an application using [dkcutter](https://dkcutter.ncontiero.com/), run any of the following four commands and answer the command prompt questions:

### npm

```bash title="terminal"
npx dkcutter gh:ncontiero/dkcutter-nextjs.git
```

### yarn

```bash title="terminal"
yarn dlx dkcutter gh:ncontiero/dkcutter-nextjs.git
```

### pnpm

```bash title="terminal"
pnpm dlx dkcutter gh:ncontiero/dkcutter-nextjs.git
```

### bun

```bash title="terminal"
bunx dkcutter@latest gh:ncontiero/dkcutter-nextjs.git
```

You'll be prompted for some values. Provide them, then a Next.Js project will be created for you.

**Warning**: After this point, change "author name", etc to your own information.

Answer the prompts with your own desired [options][options-url]. For example:

```bash title="terminal"
✔ What is the project name? … My Awesome Project
✔ What is the project slug? … my-awesome-project
✔ What is the project description? … Behold My Awesome Project!
✔ What is the author name? … Nicolas Contiero <https://github.com/ncontiero>
✔ What is the project version? … 0.1.0
✔ Do you want to use husky? … No / Yes
✔ Do you want to use lint staged? … No / Yes
✔ Do you want to use Commitlint? … No / Yes
✔ Do you want to use Next.Js app folder? … No / Yes
✔ What database ORM would you like to use? › None
✔ What Authentication Provider would you like to use? › None
✔ What Automated Dependency Updater do you want to use? › Mend Renovate
✔ Do you want the project to be configured? … No / Yes
Next steps:
  cd my-awesome-project
  pnpm install
  git add .
  git commit -m "initial commit"
  pnpm dev

✔ Project created!
```

Enter the project and take a look around:

```bash title="terminal"
cd my-awesome-project/
ls
```

Now take a look at your repo. Don't forget to carefully look at the generated README.

### Example

The following would be the structure of an application with [Commitlint](https://commitlint.js.org/):

```bash title="terminal"
pnpm dlx dkcutter https://github.com/ncontiero/dkcutter-nextjs.git --useCommitlint
```

If you want to use all the default values with the exception of one or more, you can do it as follows:

```bash title="terminal"
pnpm dlx dkcutter https://github.com/ncontiero/dkcutter-nextjs.git --useHusky --useLintStaged -y
```

This will use the default values, with the exception of the `--useHusky` and `--useLintStaged` options.
